### Open Banking and Competition in Banks and Fintech: Evidence from Mobile Apps

**Abstract:** This paper examines the impact of open banking adoption on competition and innovation in digital financial services. I construct a novel dataset by decompiling historical Android app source code to identify open banking API integrations among finance apps in the UK and EU. Linking this with monthly app performance data, I find that adoption significantly increases downloads, user activity, and revenue. Exploiting cross-country variation in authorization status within the same app, I provide causal evidence that access to consumer banking data drives these gains. Benefits are amplified during periods of heightened demand: apps with open banking performed better during the COVID-19 shock, particularly in lending, investment, and among startup fintechs. On the supply side, incumbent banks most exposed to open banking—especially in lending—face the strongest pressure, but respond by raising fee intensity and asset yields. Thus, banks are not only hurt but also adapt strategically. Overall, open banking fosters innovation while reshaping competition in the mobile finance ecosystem.

**Abstract:** This paper investigates how consumers and investors react to the standardized disclosure of data privacy practices. Since December 2020, Apple has required all apps to disclose their data collection practices by filling out privacy ''nutrition'' labels that are standardized and easy to read. We web-scrape these privacy labels and first document several stylized facts regarding the supply of privacy. Second, augmenting privacy labels with weekly app downloads and revenues, we examine how this disclosure affects consumer behavior. Exploiting the staggered release of privacy labels and using the nonexposed Android version of each app to construct the control group, we find that after privacy label release, an average iOS app experiences a 14% (15%) drop in weekly downloads (revenue) when compared to its Android counterpart. The effect is stronger for more privacy-invasive and substitutable apps. Moreover, we observe negative stock market reactions, especially among firms that harvest more data, corroborating the adverse impact on product markets. Our findings highlight data as a key asset for firms in the digital era.

## Work in Progress

### Data-driven Partnership among Firms: Evidence from GDPR

GDPR incentivizes data-driven partnerships that create value for firms. However, the increase is muted in Europe, leaving the region at a disadvantage in this emerging area of competition. 

### The Effect of Apple Transparency Tracking: An Analysis on App Monetization

Tracking apps face significant declines in downloads and revenue after Apple's App Tracking Transparency. In response, they adjust ad strategies, adopt alternative SDKs, and raise in-app prices.
